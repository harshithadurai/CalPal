# What is CalPal?

CalPal utilizes the GPT-3 OpenAI API to create calendar events out of a schedule.

For instance, consider a schedule like this:

You can simply copy and paste this onto the CalPal App:

Now you can download the corresponding calendar events!

The file is an iCal file with a .ics extension. To add to Google Calendar, this file can be directly
